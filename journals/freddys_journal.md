## 8/16

- first journal entry added, did not know the group needed these files
  in this directory

- As of now, endpoints for profile and profile lists views have been started.
  while the endpoints give back 200 responses, i placed try/except blocks in the code to catch any errors. as of now i cannot get the responses to give back the data entries and are only given back the errors i wrote in.

- Really need to figure out this one backend point to be able to test
  how front end relations work.
